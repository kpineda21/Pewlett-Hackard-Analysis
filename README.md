# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Challenge

- Pewlett Hackard has several thousand employees. We are looking toward the future in two ways, offering retirement packages for those who meet certain criteria and how many positions will need to be filled in the near future. They have 6 csv files with all the data we need to solve the problem. Also, since there are so many positions that will need to be filled they have also requested that we find employees that can stay part time and help train the new hires. These employees would be mentors.   
- The first step was to create a ERD. This helped us determine which csv file shared information with another. We then created a new table with employees whose birth dates were between 1952-1955. This narrowed down our search quite. We were also asked to create a file with employees who would be retiring from the Sales and Development team. The final step was to create a list with employees who could be considered as potential mentors to the new hires.

- We did have a questions that we want to bring up to the CEO:
  - Whatâ€™s going on with the salaries?
  - Why are there only five active managers for nine departments?
  - Why are some employees appearing twice?
- Our next step is to go even further to shorten the list. The amount of employees who will be retiring soon is significant. Some suggestions would be partial or phased retirement. It can reduce stress and increase job satisfaction. It can provide the worker with an opportunity to benefit from being a part of a work team. For the employers it can provide a cost-effective opportunity to retain people with value.
